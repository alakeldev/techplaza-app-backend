<h1 align="center">TECHPLAZA - API</h1>

**TECHPLAZA-API** The robust backend infrastructure is meticulously crafted to support the diverse functionalities of the Techplaza platform. Powered by the Django Rest Framework (DRF), the backend ensures seamless integration with the ReactJS frontend. Users can register, log in, and access various applications, including weather updates, task management, community Cards, games, and more.

## Fixed Bugs

* Throughout the development lifecycle of this project, I encountered several critical bugs and challenges. I adopted a methodical and thorough approach to ensure the delivery of robust solutions. Below are screenshots of some of the issues I addressed.

* ![Bug 1](static/readme/bug1.png)

* ![Bug 2](static/readme/bug2.png)

* ![Bug 3](static/readme/bug3.png)

* ![Bug 4](static/readme/bug4.png)

* ![Bug 5](static/readme/bug5.png)

* ![Bug 6](static/readme/bug6.png)

Additional faced bugs:

* When connecting the deployed front end of the application to the back end, an intermittent issue arose where the front-end requests were being rejected by the back-end server due to a CORS header error. The API was declining the front-end HTTP requests because the necessary CORS headers were missing in the response. The error message indicated that access to the requested resource was blocked by the CORS policy, stating: Access to XMLHttpRequest at '[backend URL]' from origin '[frontend URL]' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
Upon reviewing the Django CORS headers documentation, it was discovered that the variable previously used to provide authorized URLs to the back end, CORS_ORIGIN_WHITELIST, had been updated to CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS. Suspecting this change was the cause of the issue, the variable name was updated accordingly, and the project was redeployed. This resolved the intermittent CORS header issue.

## Unfixed Bugs

* None currently found.

# Deployment

This is a written guide on how to deploy a backend Django REST API to [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/).

Steps:

1. **Create Heroku app**
2. **Create external database**
3. **Connect external database to Heroku**
4. **Install and configure libraries**
5. **Set environment variables**
6. **Connect the project's Github repo to Heroku**

Before continuing, please ensure you are signed up and logged into [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/).

### Create Heroku App

1. On the Heroku dashboard create a new app
2. Add a name for the app (it must be unique)
3. Select a region closest to your location

### Create external database

1. Log into [Elephant SQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/) or sign up
2. Click the "Create new instance" button to start the process of creating a new database
3. Give the database a name (this is commonly the name of the project)
4. Select the tiny turtle (free) plan
5. The tags field can be left blank
6. Select a data centre region closest to your location (for me EU-West-1 (Ireland))
7. Click review and then create instance to confirm the database settings
8. Return to the dashboard and click on the database instance name
9. Copy the ElephantSQL database URL using the copy icon. The URL starts with postgres://

### Connect the external database to Heroku

1. Open the app in Heroku
2. Open the settings tab
3. Click to reveal config vars
4. Add a config var called DATABASE_URL and paste the ElephantSQL database URL into the value field

### Install and configure libraries

1. Open the project in a code editor
2. In the terminal, use the command - `pip install dj_database_url` to install the DJ Database library
3. In the app settings file add an import to the top of the file - `import dj_database_url`
4. Separate the development and production databases by replacing the DATABASES variable with the following code

```
if 'DEV' in os.environ:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
        }
    }
else:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
    }
```

5. In the terminal, use the command - `pip install gunicorn` to install gunicorn
6. Create a new file in the root directory called Procfile - this is for Heroku
7. Add the following code to let Heroku know how to run the project -

```
release: python manage.py makemigrations && python manage.py migrate
web: gunicorn techplaza_api.wsgi
```

8. In the app settings.py file, set the allowed hosts to localhost and the deployed project URL

```
ALLOWED_HOSTS = [
    "backend-techplaza-1b0c24eaa252.herokuapp.com",
    "127.0.0.1:8000",
]
RENDER_EXTERNAL_HOSTNAME = os.environ.get("RENDER_EXTERNAL_HOSTNAME")
if RENDER_EXTERNAL_HOSTNAME:
    ALLOWED_HOSTS.append(RENDER_EXTERNAL_HOSTNAME)
```

9. In the terminal, use the command - `pip install django-cors-headers` to install CORS
10. Add 'corsheaders' to the list of installed apps in the app settings.py file
11. Add 'corsheaders.middleware.CorsMiddleware' to the top of the settings.py middleware list

12. Add the following code to allow cookies - `CORS_ALLOW_CREDENTIALS = True`
13. Add the cors allowed origins list and add the front end URL to allow network requests from that URL

```
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [
    '<FRONT END APP URL>',
]
```

### Set environment variables

1. In the env.py file, include the following code to define the secret variables::

* `os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "Postgress database url******")`
* `os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "Random Key*******")`
* `os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_USER", "My Email******")`
* `os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD", "My Email Password******")`
* `os.environ.setdefault("DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL", "My Email*********")`
* `os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")`

2. In the settings.py file, ensure that the secret and strict values are appropriately targeted within the environment keys:

* `SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get("SECRET_KEY")`
* `DEBUG = os.environ.get("DEBUG")`
* `DATABASES = {"default": dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))}`
* `EMAIL_HOST_USER = os.environ.get("EMAIL_HOST_USER")`
* `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = os.environ.get("EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD")`
* `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = os.environ.get("DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL")`

4. In Heroku add new config vars with the key variables and values
5. Add a disable collect static config var - `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC = 1`
6. Add the following config vars to allow API access from dev and production URLs

```
ALLOWED_HOSTS = [
    "backend-techplaza-1b0c24eaa252.herokuapp.com",
    "127.0.0.1:8000",
]

# Below to facilitate the addition of another HOST, if necessary, through the HEROKU config variable
RENDER_EXTERNAL_HOSTNAME = os.environ.get("RENDER_EXTERNAL_HOSTNAME")
if RENDER_EXTERNAL_HOSTNAME:
    ALLOWED_HOSTS.append(RENDER_EXTERNAL_HOSTNAME)
```

7. In the project update the requirements.txt file by running the following terminal command `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
8. Git add, commit and push the code changes to the Github repository

### Connect the projects GitHub repo to Heroku

1. In the Heroku app dashboard - click the deploy tab and select GitHub as the deployment method
2. Search for the GitHub repository name and click connect
3. In the manual deploy section - choose the main / master branch
4. Click 'deploy branch' to deploy the project to Heroku - you can also watch the process by viewing the build logs
5. Once complete - open the app to view
